Hi, I am Colin McNally. I am particularly interested in development economics but understand the need for coding literacy as well as mulitlingualism in coding. I took this class as an opportunity to learn python and become a proficient coder within the space. I am an avid reader and am currently reading For Whom the Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemingway
